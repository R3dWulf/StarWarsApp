# StarWarsApp

This a Heroku app that can be found at: https://starwarsappnode.herokuapp.com
This is the first app that introduces students of the coding boot camp to Heroku. The app is not meant to be technical demostation of 
student skill sets as it is to show the server capabities of Heroku compared to the none server capabilities of Github.
